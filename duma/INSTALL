This documents describes if and how the library is installed on your system.

I. Linux/Unix environments (including Cygwin and MinGW):

  Configure the options by editing the Makefile.
    Read carefully the description of options at top of the Makefile.
    Take care for the special OS/OSTYPE depending sections.
    Especially if you are going to use the LD_PRELOAD mechanism.

  Call GNU make often called 'gmake' for building the library.
  GNU make is called 'mingw32-make' for MinGW.

  Add option 'OSTYPE=msys' when calling make for MinGW.
  Add option 'OSTYPE=cygwin' when calling make for Cygwin.
  Add option 'OS=osx' when calling make for MacOS X or Darwin.
  Add option 'OS=freebsd' when calling make for FreeBSD.

  Get system user with 'su', if you are going to install into
    system directories

  Call 'gmake install' for installation in system directories.

  Note: You need not install DUMA. Setting system PATH for duma.sh
    or INCLUDE/LIBS variables after compilation may suffice, too.
    The (outdated) manual page needs installation.


II. Windows 2000/XP, Visual Studio Environments:

  Installation is not necessary. Just set INCLUDE and LIBS directories
  in your environment or project.
