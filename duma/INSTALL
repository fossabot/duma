This documents describes if and how the library is installed on your system.

I. Linux/Unix environments (including Cygwin and MinGW):

  Configure the options by editing the Makefile.
    Read carefully the description of options at top of the Makefile.
    Especially if you are going to use the LD_PRELOAD mechanism.

  Call GNU make often called 'gmake' for building the library.

  Call 'gmake install' for installation in system directories.

  Note: You need not install DUMA. Setting system PATH for duma.sh
    or INCLUDE/LIBS variables after compilation may suffice, too.
    The (outdated) manual page needs installation.


II. Windows 2000/XP, Visual Studio Environments:

  Installation is not necessary. Just set INCLUDE and LIBS directories
  in your environment or project.
