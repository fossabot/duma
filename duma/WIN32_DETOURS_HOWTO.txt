It is now possible to use detours with duma on already compiled binaries.
This document will explain an example working configuration and environment.


Known Limitations:

 - Detours v2.1 only works with Visual Studio 2005 currently.  It does not
   build cleanly under 2003.
 - Detours v1.5 is not directly available for d/l anymore.  Contact detours
   support alias for a copy if you need support for earlier then VS 2005.


Things you will need:

 1) Detours v1.5 or v2.1, available from Microsoft research as a free download
 2) DebugView from Sysinternals, this allows you to read the debug console
 3) Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 or 2005


Conifiguration:

 1) Expand detours into your duma\detours folder
 2) Open Visual Studio command prompt, browse to duma\detours and
    build detours (nmake)
 3) Open Visual Studio, select "Detours1.5" or "Detours2.1" build (instead of 
    debug or release) and build solution
 4) Open detoursexample1 and build (debug version)
 5) Open command prompt and issue the following:
	set DUMA_OUTPUT_DEBUG=1
	set DUMA_OUTPUT_STDOUT=0
	set DUMA_OUTPUT_STDERR=0
	set DUMA_OUTPUT_STACKTRACE=1
	set DUMA_OUTPUT_STACKTRACE_MAPFILE=detoursexample1.map
 6) Copy dumadetours.exe, detoursexample1.exe, detoursexample1.map into the 
    dumadetoursdll Detours1.5 or Detours2.1 build folder
 7) Run DebugView
 8) Run "dumadetours detoursexample1.exe"
 9) You should see duma output in the DebugView window.

NOTE: For detours v2.1 you will also need detoured.dll from the detours distribution
      in the current directory.
